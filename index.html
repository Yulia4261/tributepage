It was delivered to Tsar Alexander III and given to his wife Maria Feodorovna in 1885.

            <li><strong>«Renaissance egg» </strong> - the egg was made for Alexander III of Russia, who presented it to his wife, the Empress Maria Feodorovna. It was the last egg that Alexander presented to Maria.</li>

The coronation on May 14, 1896, was a day of jubilance and pride in the Romanovs, celebrated by throngs of spectators.</li>

            <li><strong>«Lilies of the Valley egg» </strong> - is one of the two eggs in the Art Nouveau style (the other is the Pansy Egg). It was presented on April 5 to Tsar Nicholas II, who gave it as a gift to his wife, the Tsarina, Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna. </li>
